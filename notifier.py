    handed off via `systemd-run --user` so it isn't killed when this unit's
    cgroup is torn down at exit; elsewhere a plain detached Popen is enough.
    Guarded by auto_refresh_session.py's own lock file so a stuck relogin
    doesn't get relaunched on every subsequent 60s tick.

    Inside a PyInstaller-frozen build, sys.executable is the bundled binary
    itself (not a Python interpreter that can run a loose .py file) and
    AUTO_REFRESH_SCRIPT has no file on disk to point at — so instead we
    re-invoke the binary with a hidden flag that app.py dispatches straight
    to auto_refresh_session.main(), keeping it a separate detached process.

    force=True (the manual "Open browser" button) kills whatever's holding the
    lock and relaunches anyway. This exists because the lock has no timeout
    (auto_refresh_session.py waits indefinitely for a QR scan) and survives
    app.py restarts, since the Chrome+QR process it guards is detached —
    the most common way this bites someone is a QR window left open and
    forgotten from a previous session (confirmed live: a lock stayed held
    for ~10 hours), which silently no-ops every later auto-trigger,
    including the very next app launch, with no visible sign why. The
    automatic path stays conservative (never force); force is opt-in so a
    background retry never kills a window the user is mid-scan on.

    notify_phone=False (the manual "Open browser"/login-screen buttons) skips
    the ntfy push telling the user to go scan a QR — they just clicked a
    button and are already sitting in front of Chrome watching it open, so a
    phone notification saying the same thing is just noise (and, worse, reads
    as an alert when nothing's actually wrong). The automatic auth_expired
    path keeps the push, since that's the one case where the user genuinely
    isn't watching and needs the nudge. The desktop notification still fires
    either way — it's local and harmless.

    the login step that otherwise costs you the fastest-moving slots.

    Skipped if something's already answering on OPEN_BROWSER_PORT (its own
    dedicated debug port) so a slot that keeps reappearing under a new
    signature doesn't pile up duplicate Chrome windows — you'll just have
    the one from the first hit to work with.

    Same frozen-build re-invocation trick as trigger_auto_refresh() — see
    its docstring — since sys.executable is the bundled binary itself
    inside a PyInstaller build, not a Python interpreter that can run a
    loose .py file.

    auto_click=False (the manual "Open browser" button when the session is
    still valid) passes --no-auto-click through, so it just opens the
    logged-in tab without clicking through to the reschedule date-picker —
    that click-through is only wanted for the automatic urgent-slot-hit
    path, which keeps the default auto_click=True.

    target_hit, when given together with auto_click and config's
    experimental, default-off "auto_select_slot" flag, is one of
    run_check()'s hit_dicts (word/exam_type/datetime/places) — passed
    through as --target-slot JSON so open_logged_in_browser.py can also try
    to expand that date's slot group, select the matching time radio
    button, and click through to the summary/review screen, past the plain
    date-picker screen.

    A second, separate, also default-off flag — config's
    "auto_confirm_reschedule" — additionally passes --confirm-reschedule,
    which (only once auto_select_slot has already landed on the summary
    screen, and only after open_logged_in_browser.py itself re-verifies
    that screen matches the intended slot) clicks through the final
    "Potwierdź i przejdź dalej" confirm button — actually submitting the
    reservation change. auto_confirm_reschedule alone, without
    auto_select_slot, does nothing (no --target-slot means
    open_logged_in_browser.py never reaches that screen to confirm on).
    UNVERIFIED against the live site as of 2026-07-20, by explicit user
    request that same day — see open_logged_in_browser.py's own docstrings
    for exactly what it does and does not click, and the verification step
    that gates the final click. Both flags are omitted entirely (no
    --target-slot/--confirm-reschedule at all) whenever off, so a config
    predating this feature behaves identically to before.

    --confirm-reschedule is further gated by confirm_reschedule_cooldown_active()
    (see its own docstring) — even with auto_confirm_reschedule on, it's
    withheld (falling back to --target-slot alone, same as auto_select_slot
    without auto_confirm_reschedule) if a confirm attempt was made too
    recently, regardless of whether that attempt's own outcome is known.

    The launched subprocess's stdout/stderr go to RESCHEDULE_LOG_FILE
    (append mode) rather than DEVNULL — this is a
    detached, fire-and-forget launch with no other way for its outcome to
    reach anyone, and open_logged_in_browser.py's own print()s are the only
    record of what an auto-triggered run actually did, especially the
    "couldn't verify automatically — check yourself" messages past the
    confirm click.

    Returns one of the TRIGGER_* outcome constants. No force option here
    (unlike trigger_auto_refresh) — forcing would mean launching a second
    Chrome on the same fixed debug port an already-open one is using, which
    is fragile rather than useful; if one's already open that's already the
    outcome a caller wants.
