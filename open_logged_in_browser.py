    confirm=True — only ever set when config's separate, also-experimental
    auto_confirm_reschedule flag is on, by explicit user request as of

    becoming clickable, stops short of that click every time.

    navigates to /cases and, if wait_and_verify_booking() confirms the

    re-triggering auto_confirm_reschedule on a slot we already booked
    into. Skipped (config left untouched) if that verification doesn't
    succeed within its timeout.

    Two more things happen once confirm=True, both added 2026-07-20 as a
    direct follow-up to a code review that flagged this whole flow's
    outcomes as otherwise invisible when auto-triggered (stdout used to go
    to DEVNULL — see trigger_open_browser()'s own docstring, now fixed at
