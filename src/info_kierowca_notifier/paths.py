"""Single owner of the runtime state/config file locations.

These paths used to be re-spelled in five modules (notifier, app,
auth.session, booking.reschedule, web.server, browser.cdp).
That mattered more than it looks: the project's promise that a packaged
binary and a `python -m info_kierowca_notifier` run share the same config,
session and history
holds only as long as every one of those copies agrees, and a typo in any of
them would silently split state in two rather than fail loudly.

This module deliberately imports nothing from the rest of the project, so it
can sit at the bottom of the import graph and be safely imported everywhere.
