    as a subprocess — stop_event lets that thread be told to exit cleanly.

    `interval` is only the fallback default passed to configured_poll_interval()

    dashboard's countdown (and the actual next check) staying stuck on

    doesn't itself clear the flag), making it return instantly and then get
    cleared by the old post-wait clear(), triggering one wasted immediate
    extra check even though this cycle's wait_s already reflects the fresh
    config (configured_poll_interval() re-reads config.json every call).
    Clearing right before wait() discards exactly that stale signal while

    returns early as intended, and the flag it leaves set is what the next
