update_current_slot_date()) — otherwise it writes nothing except its own
progress to RESCHEDULE_LOG_FILE (see push_ntfy()'s docstring for why this

    doesn't attempt to drive that date input. Confirmed live 2026-07-20:
    the field only matters for pushing the window further out than that.

    Expands the date group matching the target's date, selects the radio
    button matching its exam type + time, then clicks "Przejdź do
    podsumowania" (go to summary) to land on the "Potwierdź wybrany
    egzamin" summary modal. If any of that fails (slot already taken by
    someone else, or a DOM this hasn't been verified against), it stops
    immediately and leaves you to pick it by hand — this never guesses.

    confirm=False (the default) stops there, same as before 2026-07-20.

    confirm=True — only ever set when config's separate, also-experimental
    auto_confirm_reschedule flag is on, by explicit user request as of
    2026-07-20 — goes one click further, behind three gates added 2026-08-11:
    the target must still beat config.json's current_slot_date
    (target_beats_current_slot(), re-read here rather than trusted from the
    launch that happened minutes ago), the summary *modal* must show the
    intended date/time/exam type/centre (wait_and_verify_summary(), scoped to
    the modal rather than the whole page), and the repeat-confirm cooldown must
    be armed. Only then does it click CONFIRM_SUMMARY_TEXT ("Potwierdź i
    przejdź dalej") — via click_confirm_once(), never the retrying poller, so a
    lost CDP response can't turn into a second submission. That click submits
    the actual reservation change, the one action in this file that can't be
    undone by closing the tab. Any gate failing, or the button never becoming
    clickable, stops short of it every time, and every stop before the click
    releases the launch-time cooldown so the next cycle may try again.

    After that click, a separate explicit CDP target navigates to /cases while
    the transaction target remains untouched. If structured card verification
    confirms the booking now actually shows our slot as "Potwierdzona", this updates
    config.json's current_slot_date to match
    (update_current_slot_date()) — so notifier.is_urgent()'s next
    comparison reflects the change immediately instead of possibly
    re-triggering auto_confirm_reschedule on a slot we already booked
    into. Skipped (config left untouched) if that verification doesn't
    succeed within its timeout.

    Two more things happen once confirm=True, both added 2026-07-20 as a
    direct follow-up to a code review that flagged this whole flow's
    outcomes as otherwise invisible when auto-triggered (stdout used to go
    to DEVNULL — see trigger_open_browser()'s own docstring, now fixed at
    that end) and re-triggerable while a prior attempt's outcome was still
    unknown: (1) RESCHEDULE_CONFIRM_COOLDOWN_FILE, which
    booking.launch.confirm_reschedule_cooldown_active() checks before ever
    passing --confirm-reschedule again — armed by trigger_open_browser() at
    launch time (see record_confirm_cooldown()/release_confirm_cooldown() for
    why it moved there) and refreshed here right before the submit click, with
    the outcome, once one is known; (2) a push notification
    (push_ntfy(), reusing config's existing ntfy_topic) fires for every
    outcome from that point on — summary mismatch, confirm button
    unclickable, confirmed-but-unverified, or confirmed-and-verified —
    since none of those are things that should only be discoverable by
    someone happening to be watching the Chrome window.
